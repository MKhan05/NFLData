First to read in and display our data:

```{r}
my_url = "http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/%7ebutler/c32/qbrating.txt"

qbrating = read.table(my_url, head=T)
qbrating
```

Steps:
-Introduction
-Adjust the units of the data before any analysis can be done (b/c its per game not per season or vice versa) *If the stat is per game multiply it by 16 to get the value for the whole season because an NFL season consists of 16 games*
-Potential Residual Plot
-Run a multiple regression
-See which variables are significant
-Run the regression again without the insignificant variables
-Summary/Conclusion



test - Vincent
test - Stephen hello world
